## About The Project

This project concerns the automatic extraction of all information in excel documents

The objective here was to build algorithms capable of extracting a set of information
automatically and quickly in Excel files and insert them into databases.

This work cannot be done by hand because of the multitude of files to be processed, and also
the existing libraries being limited because of the no structuring of the information to be extracted, it
It was therefore a question of building a personalized algorithm.

We have made all used codes available as a jupyter notebook file.

## Built With

We used the following main languages and librairies

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
